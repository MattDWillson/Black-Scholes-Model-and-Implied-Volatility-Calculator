# Black-Scholes-Model-and-Implied-Volatility-Calculator
This is a simple Black Scholes formula. You can adjust variables and return an option price. In addition to the Black Scholes model, there is an implied volatility calculator. Since implied volatility factors in the price of the option premium - you will need the actual price of the option from a brokerage to view the accurate implied volatility.
